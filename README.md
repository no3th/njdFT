# Branch: Media

This filetree is suitable for storing digital media that is not time bound or project bound like in the default NJD setup.

We distinguish between "Media" and "Entertainment" like so -
- Media - Content that is meant to complement work, and not distract you from it. Lectures, Tutorials, Documentaries etc. fit this definition.
- Entertainment - Content that is meant purely for consumption, and might end up reeling you into a blackhole of procrastination.

## Entertainment
Our suggestion is to store all of your Movies, Anime and TV Shows into a separate external drive and copy them to your machine as and when you need them so that any source of distraction is out of sight (and out of mind)

## Media 
Our folders for "Video" and "Video Playlists" are roughly derived from the YouTube space. Any help in further disambiguating these would be appreciated.
